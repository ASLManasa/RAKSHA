# RAKSHA

## Setup

Assuming you have Ananconda or Miniconda3 already working, create a tensorflow conda environment and install a few libraries into it, and then we're ready to go.

* Install the current release of CPU-only TensorFlow, recommended for beginners:

```bash
conda create -n tf tensorflow
conda activate tf
```

* Install dependencies

> pip install -r requirements.txt
